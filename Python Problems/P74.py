# You have a grid with N rows and M columns. You have two types of tiles — one of dimensions 2×2 and the other of dimensions 1×1. You want to cover the grid using these two types of tiles in such a way that:

# Each cell of the grid is covered by exactly one tile; and
# The number of 1×1 tiles used is minimized.
# Find the minimum number of 1×1 tiles you have to use to fill the grid.
