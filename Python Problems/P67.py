# For her next karate demonstration, Arunima will break some bricks.

# Arunima stacked three bricks on top of each other. Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.

# Arunima strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest kâ‰¥0 such that the sum of widths of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. Before each hit, Arunima may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.

# Find the minimum number of hits Arunima needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally. You are not required to minimize the number of reversals.
