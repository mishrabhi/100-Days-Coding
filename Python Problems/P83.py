# Given a complete binary tree with the height of H, we index the nodes respectively top-down and left-right from 1. The i-th node stores a positive integer Vi. Define Pi as follows: Pi=Vi if the i-th node is a leaf, otherwise Pi=max(Vi*PL, Vi*PR), where L and R are the indices of the left and right children of i, respectively. Your task is to caculate the value of P1.

# Input

# There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:

# The first line contains a positive integer H (H â‰¤ 15).
# The second line contains 2H-1 positive integers (each having a value of 109 at most), the i-th integer shows the value of Vi.
# The input is ended with H = 0.
