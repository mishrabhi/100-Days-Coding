# You have a binary string S of length N. In one operation you can select a substring of S and reverse it. For example, on reversing the substring [2,4]S[2,4] for S=11000, we change 11000â†’10010.

# Find the minimum number of operations required to sort this binary string.
# It can be proven that the string can always be sorted using the above operation finite number of times
