# Ajinkya decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B. Other than that, he only has one criterion â€” the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.

# Ajinkya has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are N available tablets, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.

# Help Ajinkya choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet
